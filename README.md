# Card-Guess-Game

Made a website containing the Card Guessing Game with HTML,CSS and Javascript.

The user will get an interface with hidden cards if the user click on the any card then the picture unwrapped then the user must choose the other card ,if the user click the same picture then he/she will get 1 point and score keeps updating until user choose the same and correct card.

If the user fails to choose right choice then GAME OVER! Score then reupdated to 0.

Then start the new game and try to beat your past score :)

All the best
